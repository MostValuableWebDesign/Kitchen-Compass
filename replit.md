# Kitchen Compass

Kitchen Compass is an iPhone companion for scanning, confirming, organizing, and cooking with the ingredients already at home.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run the API server (port 5000)
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- API: Express 5
- DB: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- API codegen: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- Build: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Where things live

- `artifacts/kitchen-compass/app/` — Expo Router screens for Today, My Kitchen, Scan, Recipes, Meal Plan, recipe detail, and cooking mode.
- `artifacts/kitchen-compass/context/KitchenContext.tsx` — AsyncStorage-backed inventory, preferences, and meal-plan state.
- `artifacts/kitchen-compass/data/recipes.ts` — curated recipe content and cooking instructions used by the first build.
- `artifacts/kitchen-compass/constants/colors.ts` — Kitchen Compass light and dark semantic theme tokens.
- `artifacts/kitchen-compass/assets/images/` — app icon and generated recipe visuals.

## Architecture decisions

- The first mobile build is frontend-only and uses AsyncStorage so the core workflow works offline.
- Camera and photo-library access use Expo ImagePicker's native entry points; every captured photo pauses at a review screen.
- Photo recognition is intentionally not represented as working until a vision service is configured; uncertain manually confirmed photo entries are labeled.
- Planned meals reserve conceptually but do not deduct inventory; cooking mode applies a single used status when a meal is marked cooked.

## Product

- Today shows the current day's meals, use-soon ingredients, and quick recipe inspiration.
- My Kitchen supports searchable storage locations, quantity-unknown labels, running-low toggles, and removal.
- Scan supports real camera capture, photo-library selection, and manual ingredient entry with confirmation.
- Recipes include inventory-aware status, nutrition estimates, health-score explanations, ingredients, and detailed cooking mode with timers.
- Meal Plan supports seven days of breakfast, lunch, and dinner slots with persistent swaps.

## User preferences

- The product should be warm, welcoming, food-focused, and readable with generous touch targets.

## Gotchas

- Native camera and persistence behavior still need physical-iPhone verification through Expo Go or a development build.
- The Expo workflow can log a missing React Native DevTools `libglib-2.0.so.0` message while Metro still runs normally.
